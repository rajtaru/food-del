## 💡 My Feedback & Suggestions

- This README template is **very clear**: it explains *what* the project is, *how to run it*, and *what tech is used*.  
- If you can add **screenshots or GIFs**, your README will look way more professional — clients will love it.  
- When you build your next two projects (which you said you'll do), use a **similar structured README** — consistency in your repos helps.

If you like, I can **review your current README** (just paste the text of your README here) and give *exact fixes*. Do you want me to do that?
